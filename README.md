# dtmScript

This is just a simple script that maps adobe's dynamic tag manager rules to the reports they control. This will eventaully be more automated, but currently it still requires an export of an omniture file. The omniture file contains all the events,evars, and props that are used. Once you have the export you just run the python progam and let the parsing begin. This will generate a simple html file that you can search for reports and the rules associated with them.
